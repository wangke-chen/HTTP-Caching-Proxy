Feb 23th:
Remote server will always listen on port 80.
Host computer should connect the proxy on port 12345.
Header field can be case-insensitive.

Feb 24th:
Length of header fields and message bodies can be various.
Header field of requests and responses would end with "\r\n\r\n".
Message bodies' length would depend on the header field---"Content-Length".
Some message bodies might be encoded as chunked or gzip.
If requests with multiple Content-Length header fields having differing field-value, the server should respond with a 400 status code.
If responses with multiple Content-Length header fields having differing field-value, the proxy should send a 502 status code.

Feb 25th:
What if the message communicating between brower and proxy or proxy and remote servers is 0?

Feb 26th:
The resource of stack is limited.
The browser's ip should be stored on heap to transfer between functions.

Our proxy is able to:
Deal with message with size of 0. Once we send or receive a message with size of 0, we return the function with -1, indicating error.
Deal with the situation that the proxy cannot create a socket. We will repeat the socket-creating process until success.
Deal with chunked messages, We will decode it as instructed on RFC 7230.
Deal with the browser tab closing halfway. We will get a message from browser with size of 0, and then we return -1 to indicate the connection is closed.

We mostly return -1 in some function when meeting some errors and then the current thread is able to go to the end.
And our proxy maintains a exception level of basic exception guarantee.
